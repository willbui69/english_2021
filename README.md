# Initial Setup with Webpack

The goal of this repo is used for inital setup for every project using webpack.

It provides the base for developers, so they will not spend too much time for setting up things that are in common in every project.

## Get Up and Running

Fork this repo, then clone your forked repo down to your computer:

```
git clone -- git@github.com:[your-user-name]/webpack-express.git --
```

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run build-dev``` for development mode
- ```npm run build-prod``` for production mode
- ```npm start``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:8080, but you can of course edit that in index.js
