# problem and mission identifications

The mission of this project is forming a learning platform where Vietnamese people can easily develop the cornerstone of English language.
While there are multiple Vietnamese sources for english learners out there, it is hard to find one that reliable, systematical and importantly accessible freely. As a result, this public project is introduce to fill this gap.

# For English experts

This learning platform aims to provide the foundation for Vietnamese learners on their way of mastering English language. I believe that the knowledge base plays an important role for people who lost their track of learning English. I also hold a belief that the base knowlege is not the basic knowledge as many think, but the crucial part and maybe the hard bits for anyone to grab. Thus, we will design an English course so learners have a sense of confidence to move on forwards with other advanced courses after they mastering all topics provided by us.

The content of this course will be divided into weekly classes. Each week, we will teach different topics in order from easy to hard. Initialy, we have:

 Week 0: Learn how to learn
 Week 1: English word classes
 Week 2: English sentence structure
 Week 3: English Tenses
 Week 4: English Pronunciation
 Week 5: English Expression
 Week 6: English in Real Life
 Week 7: English in Academic Environment

 It would be great to see the future changes in our course's syllabus from all of you. Besides that, we are struggling to seek for the best knowledge for each topic. Therefore, We are inviting you to:

 - Evaluate the current knowledge that we have already built.
 - Sugguest any advice and idea that we can improve the course's structure.
 - Offer other teaching metarials so that we can perfect each week lesson.

Any contributions from you in this project will be acknowledged. Without your expertise, this project is not possible!
